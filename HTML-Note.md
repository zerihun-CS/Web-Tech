# HTML CSS JS

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the three fundamental technologies used to create websites. Each technology serves a specific purpose in the web development process.

## HTML

HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create web pages. HTML provides the structure of a web page by using tags to define page elements such as headings, paragraphs, images, and links.

## CSS

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a web page. CSS separates the presentation from the content of a web page, allowing developers to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other design aspects of a website.

## JavaScript

JavaScript is a programming language used to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to web pages. With JavaScript, developers can create interactive elements such as pop-ups, slide shows, and menus. JavaScript is also used to validate forms, create animations, and perform other client-side tasks.

In summary, HTML provides the structure of a web page, CSS provides the styling, and JavaScript provides the interactivity. Together, these technologies allow web developers to create rich, engaging, and dynamic websites.
